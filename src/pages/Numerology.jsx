  { q: 'What type of numerology do you practice?', a: 'I combine Vedic and Chinese numerology with grid-based profiling for a comprehensive character and life-path analysis that goes deeper than traditional methods.' },
  { q: 'Do I need to prepare anything before a session?', a: 'Just your full birthdate and the name on your birth certificate. No prior knowledge of numerology is needed — I guide you through everything.' },
  { q: 'Is this about predicting the future?', a: 'Not at all. Numerology reveals patterns tendencies and timing in your life. It helps you make better-informed decisions rather than telling you what will happen.' },
  { q: 'How long is a session?', a: 'A typical numerology session runs 60–90 minutes. It\'s thorough and personalized — not a generic reading.' },

                As a professional numerologist, I combine the precision of ancient Vedic and Chinese
                numerology with a unique grid-based profiling system to decode the blueprint of your life.

                This isn't just number crunching. It's deep character analysis — designed to reveal
                your personality patterns natural strengths, emotional tendencies and even the timing
                of key life events. My custom-designed grids blend numerology with character archetypes
                and behavioural insights to map out your life cycles — giving you clarity on where you
                are, what's influencing you and what's coming next.

                Whether you're a working professional at a career crossroads, a student unsure of your
                direction, or a business owner looking to build a strong team, numerology offers
                something powerful insight. I help individuals understand their core energies, pinpoint
                hidden challenges and align with their strengths to make more confident, purpose-driven
                decisions.

                My sessions also dive into relationship dynamics — whether it's between partners,
                parents and children or team members — offering practical understanding of compatibility
                and communication patterns.

                This work is not abstract. It's grounded, logical and directly applicable to real life.
                Clients leave our sessions feeling clearer about their direction, more confident in their
                decisions and better equipped to handle life's transitions.
